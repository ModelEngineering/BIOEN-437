# FEEDBACK FROM STUDENTS

* Make sure that the folders in the shared drive correspond with the lectures

* More in-class active learning

* Helpers in notebooks should be self-contained so can easily copy from notebook to notebook

* Notebooks should be a clean description of the course materials. Consider embedding power point in the notebooks (as Tony did)

* Do a lesson on creating PyPI packages

* Develop on-line background materials
